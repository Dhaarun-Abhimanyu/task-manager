# task-manager

## Abstract

This is a simple project to manage tasks - to add, delete and update tasks and manage them. Tasks can be given priority(low, medium and high) with statuses(complete or incomplete) and sorted accordingly based on the last added task. It uses [express](https://expressjs.com) for backend, [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com) for database, and [react]() (only a basic implementation) for user interace.
